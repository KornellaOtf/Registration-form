HTML Forms Implementation Assignment
Project Description
This repository contains a semantic HTML implementation of a registration form for the HTML Forms Implementation Assignment. The form is designed to collect user information in a structured, accessible, and semantically correct manner, adhering to HTML5 standards and best practices. The focus is on functionality and semantic structure without CSS styling, as per the assignment requirements.
Purpose of the Form
The form is a comprehensive registration form intended to collect:

Personal Information: First name, last name, date of birth, and gender.
Contact Information: Email address and phone number.
Address Information: Street address, city, state, and ZIP code.
Account Information: Username, password, and password confirmation.
Preferences: Option to subscribe to a newsletter.
Terms Agreement: Agreement to terms and conditions.

The form is organized into logical sections to improve usability and accessibility.

index.html: Contains the complete HTML form implementation with semantic structure and accessibility features.
README.md: This file, documenting the repository’s purpose, implementation approach, and usage instructions.

Implementation Notes

Semantic HTML: The form uses semantic elements like <main>, <section>, <h1>, <h2>, and <label> to ensure meaningful structure. Each section is marked with aria-labelledby to associate headings with content for screen readers.
Accessibility: 
All input fields have associated <label> elements.
Required fields are marked with required and aria-required="true".
Placeholder text is used to guide users but not as a substitute for labels.
The terms link includes an aria-label for clarity.
The form uses novalidate to allow custom validation if needed, though no JavaScript is included as per the focus on HTML.


Form Structure: The form is divided into sections (Personal, Contact, Address, Account, Preferences) for clarity and logical grouping.
Input Types: Appropriate input types (text, email, tel, date, password, checkbox, select) are used to ensure proper user interaction and validation.
Patterns: Regular expression patterns are applied to phone ([0-9]{10}) and ZIP code ([0-9]{5}) fields for basic validation.
No Styling: As specified, no CSS is included to focus on semantic structure and functionality.

How to Use/View the Form

Clone or download this repository from GitHub.
Open index.html in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
The form will display with all fields and sections, ready for user input.
Test the form by filling out the fields and submitting it. Note that the action="/submit" is a placeholder, as no backend is implemented.

Additional Notes

The form is designed to be functional and accessible in all modern browsers.
The implementation assumes a generic registration form due to the absence of the specific PDF specifications. Adjust fields as needed based on actual requirements.
The repository is public and accessible for submission purposes.
For further customization, JavaScript can be added for client-side validation, or CSS can be applied for styling, though these are outside the assignment’s scope.
